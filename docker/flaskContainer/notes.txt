Our flask app is a flask app
Want to use nginx to host our server
nginx does static stuff, not dynamic applications.
uwsgi is the go between, it runs our app, and handles traffic between the app and nginx


Our container should be from nginx, and should pip install all our dependencies (flask, etc), as well as uwsgi

read more about uswgi and flask. And sockets. Or something
We might need to get a couple things running from one container.
